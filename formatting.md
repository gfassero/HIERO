# Formatting
HIERO is formatted to indicate features of the Hebrew text. The [formatting key](read/key.html) gives examples of formatting in HIERO.

## Header material
- The links at the top of the translation link to the *parashah peh* “open portion” section breaks (§) found in the Hebrew text.
- Book titles are given as found in most modern Christian Bibles.
- Book subtitles are given as translated from the traditional Hebrew titles.

## Verse & Chapter Numbering
Verses are numbered in small type (<sub>123</sub>). Chapters are numbered in bold (**123**). Verses in Aramaic have a small triangle (&#9653;) before their verse numbers.

## Capitalization
Capitalization does not reflect any feature of the Hebrew text. Words that appear to be proper nouns are capitalized.

## Inflections
### Gender
Words with identifiable gender are underlined solid (masculine) or dashed (feminine). Where the gender has not been identified, the word is not underlined. There are only two genders: masculine and feminine.
### Number
Words in the plural are followed by a superscript plus sign (⁺). Words in the dual are followed by a superscript number two (²). Words in the singular are not marked.
### Tense (Aspect)
The two Hebrew verb tenses (or aspects), are translated as the English past and present tense. However, these tenses do not mean the same thing as in English.

## Lexicon Entries
### The Divine Name
Small caps represent the divine name (Yʜᴡʜ) and its abbreviations (Yʜ).
### Multi-Word Translations
Hebrew words usually have more morphemes than English words, so each Hebrew word is represented by multiple English words joined with a middle dot (·).
### Inline Comments
Gray text marks a part of a translation that is not derived from the Hebrew root but that seems essential to the meaning. The black text indicates what the text says; the gray indicates what it means.
### Transliterations & Cognates
Italic text (*italic*) marks a word that is transliterated from the Hebrew root, or a close English cognate of the Hebrew root.
### Questions
An inverted question mark (¿) precedes words that usually introduce a question. The question may begin with this word, but does not always. Not all questions are marked, as Hebrew does not have a question mark.
### Gentilic Nouns
Proper nouns denoting the descendants of an individual or the inhabitants of a place are generally translated by appending the suffix “-ïte” to the name of the individual or place. The diaeresis is included to help the reader distinguish between the translated name and the suffix.

## Particles and suffixes
### Direct Object Marker
The degree sign (°) represents the Hebrew direct object particle את.
### Directional Suffix
A rightward-pointing arrow (→) precedes words bearing the directional suffix ה.

## Breaks
Line breaks, section breaks, and punctuation are derived from the Hebrew punctuation and cantillation marks:
- A section break (§) represents a *parashah peh* “open portion” break.
- A paragraph break represents a *parashah setumah* “closed portion” break.
- A colon (:) at the end of a line represents a *sof passuk* punctuation mark.
- An indentation represents an *etnachta*, a *segol*, or an *ole we-jored* cantillation mark.
- A double indentation represents a *zakef katan* cantillation mark.
Other cantillation marks are ignored.

Lines long enough to wrap at the edge of the screen or column are broken by a dash (–).

## Exclamation Marks
There are three kinds of exclamation marks in HIERO:
- Interjections are preceded by an inverted question mark and followed by a question mark (¡please!).
- An exclamation mark (!) without an inverted exclamation represents the paragogic suffix ה.
- A superscript exclamation mark (ꜝ) precedes volative verbs (commands, cohortatives, and jussives).
- The paragogic suffix may be paired with a volative verb (ꜝarise!).
