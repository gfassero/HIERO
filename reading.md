# Hebrew Idiom Quickstart
A few facts about Hebrew that may help you understand HIERO’s translation:
### There is a dual number.
Nouns, adjectives, and verbs have number. In addition to singular and plural number, Hebrew also offers a dual number, representing two of something. Two of something can be represented by either the dual or the plural. The dual usually represents not simply two things, but usually a pair of things, most often a part of the body.
### There are only two genders.
Hebrew has only two genders—masculine and feminine—and no neuter gender. In HIERO, masculine words are underlined with a thin gray line, and feminine words are underlined with a thick dashed line. Nouns, adjectives, and verbs without an underline still have gender, but HIERO has not been able to identify their gender yet.
### Verbs have gender.
Hebrew nouns, adjectives, and verbs are gendered (except first-person verbs). Verbs are gendered to match their subjects, just as adjectives are gendered to match their nouns.
### “°” marks the direct object.
Hebrew has an untranslatable word *'et* that exists to point out the direct object of a verb. Like a preposition, it always precedes its object immediately. In HIERO, it is represented by the degree sign (°). The object is not always marked with this word, but it is helpful when it appears.
### Word order varies.
Expect some variation in word order. The normal order is Verb-Subject-Object, but other orders are common as well. Gender can provide a clue in matching a verb to its subject, just as in matching a modifier to what it modifies. The direct object marker, when present, is the best identifier of the object. 
### There is no copula.
Hebrew has no “be” verb that functions as a copula. This means that some sentences do not have verbs. “Be” verbs, where they appear, have existential import.
### Distinct adverbs are rare.
Hebrew has few adverbs. Instead, nouns will appear in the text with a kind of adverbial function. Read them as “with *x*” or “in *x*” if that helps.
### Adjectives and participles can serve as nouns.
This happens in English too:
- “The faithful” (adjective as noun)
- “The suffering” (active participle as noun)
- “The fallen” (passive participle as noun)
This is very common in Hebrew, and it can be disorienting. If you see “the” followed by an adjective or participle and no noun, this is probably why. Read as “*x* one(s)” if that helps. For active participles, consider reading it as an agent: For example, “he ruling” may mean “he [was] ruler.”
### Verse breaks
The verse breaks usually follow the *sof passuk* punctuation marks in the Hebrew text. *Sof passuk*, which looks like a colon (:), is stronger than a comma but often weaker than a period.
### Line breaks
The line breaks are based on a selection of *cantillation marks* in the Hebrew text. These usually have punctuating force, but their weight can vary. There can be a need for mental punctuation mid-line as well, so the reader should be alert to the needs of the text. Cantillation is more like music notation than like punctuation, so think of how song lyric lines do not always correspond to punctuation—they are more of an indication of where the author wants you to pause than of grammatical structure.
### Section and paragraph breaks
The chapter breaks do not exist in Hebrew. Instead, Hebrew has two different kinds of section breaks. HIERO represents the minor break as a paragraph break and the major break as a section break (§). At the top of the page, HIERO lists all the section breaks in the book as a kind of table of contents.
### Prepositions
Hebrew does not have a great variety of preposition or conjunctions. To make up for this, they will sometimes use a string of prepositions with a single noun. Take them lightly, because HIERO does not do much with them yet. You may notice patterns in how they are used.
### Numbers
Numbers (spelled out, not numerals) can appear as singulars or as plurals, with extra articles and prepositions, and in strange places. HIERO does not address this yet.

# Formatting
HIERO is formatted to indicate features of the Hebrew text:
- Verses are numbered in small type (<sub>123</sub>). Chapters are numbered in bold (**123**) and surrounded by a gray disk ![gray](https://placehold.co/15x15/808080/808080.png).
- Capitalization does not reflect any feature of the Hebrew text. Words that appear to be proper nouns are capitalized.
- Inflections:
  - Words with identifiable gender are underlined solid (masculine) or dashed (feminine). Where the gender has not been identified, the word is not underlined. There are only two genders: masculine and feminine.
  - Words in the plural are followed by a superscript plus sign (⁺). Words in the dual are followed by a superscript number two (²). Words in the singular are not marked.
  - The two Hebrew verb tenses (or aspects), are translated as the English past and present tense. However, these tenses do not mean the same thing as in English.
- Lexicon:
  - Small caps represent the divine name (Yʜᴡʜ) and its abbreviations (Yʜ).
  - Hebrew words usually have more morphemes than English words, so each Hebrew word is represented by multiple English words joined with a middle dot (·).
  - Gray text ![gray](https://placehold.co/15x15/808080/808080.png) marks a part of a translation that is not derived from the Hebrew root but that seems essential to the meaning. The black text indicates what the text says; the gray indicates what it means.
  - Italic text (*italic*) marks a word that is transliterated from the Hebrew root, either because the transliteration is familiar in English, or because the meaning is unknown.
  - An inverted question mark (¿) precedes words that usually introduce a question. The question may begin with this word, but does not always. Not all questions are marked, as Hebrew does not have a question mark.
  - The logical “not” sign (¬) precedes a word (usually a proper noun) that has not been translated yet.
  - Proper nouns denoting the descendants of an individual or the inhabitants of a place are generally translated by appending the suffix “-ïte” to the name of the individual or place. The diaeresis is included to help the reader distinguish between the translated name and the suffix.
- Particles and suffixes:
  - The degree sign (°) represents the Hebrew direct object particle את.
  - A rightward-pointing arrow (→) precedes words bearing the directional suffix ה.
- There are three kinds of exclamation marks in HIERO:
  - Interjections are preceded by an inverted question mark and followed by a question mark (¡please!).
  - An exclamation mark (!) without an inverted exclamation represents the paragogic suffix ה.
  - A superscript exclamation mark (ꜝ) precedes volative verbs (commands, cohortatives, and jussives).
  - The paragogic suffix may be paired with a volative verb (ꜝarise!).
- Line breaks, section breaks, and punctuation are derived from the Hebrew punctuation and cantillation marks:
  - A section break (§) represents a *parashah peh* “open portion” break.
  - A paragraph break represents a *parashah setumah* “closed portion” break.
  - A colon (:) at the end of a line represents a *sof passuk* punctuation mark.
  - An indentation represents an *etnachta*, a *segol*, or an *ole we-jored* cantillation mark.
  - A double indentation represents a *zakef katan* cantillation mark.
  - A comma (,) represents a *pazer* cantillation mark.
  - Other cantillation marks are ignored.
- Header material
  - The links at the top of the translation link to the *parashah peh* “open portion” section breaks (§).
  - Book titles are given as found in most modern Christian Bibles.
  - Book subtitles are given as translated from the traditional Hebrew titles.
