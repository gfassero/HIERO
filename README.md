# Introduction
HIERO (Hebrew Idiom in English Roots) is a partial translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew into English, in which Hebrew word order and vocabulary choices are transparent to the reader. Its intended audience is studious English readers with little or no knowledge of the Hebrew language. Its purpose is to give some insight into the poetic idiom that the sacred authors chose to use.

You can browse the [full HIERO translation here](read/). Or read one of the following familiar passages:
- [The Creation](output%20samples/creation.html) (Genesis 1)
- [The Binding of Isaac](output%20samples/akedah.html) (Genesis 22)
- [The Shema](output%20samples/shema.html) (Deuteronomy 6)
- [Psalm 1](output%20samples/psalm001.html)
- [Psalm 51](output%20samples/psalm051.html)
- [Psalm 121](output%20samples/psalm121.html)
- [The Suffering Servant](output%20samples/servant.html) (Isaiah 53)
- [The final promise](output%20samples/final.html) (Malachi 4).

# Rationale
Modern English readers are blessed with more and better translations of the Bible than anyone else in history. Some translations specialize in theological precision, others swell with rhetorical beauty, and others use such everyday words that they sound like they were written yesterday. The Hebrew scriptures, however, are not written in modern, everyday language, modern technical language, or even classical rhetorical language. They are written in ancient Hebrew poetry, and HIERO tries to reflects that.

HIERO does not try to interpret the Hebrew scriptures in a precise, beautiful, or accessible way. Instead—recognizing the word choice and word order are two of the most basic elements of poetry—HIERO tries to represent the Hebrew idiom in a way that lets the English reader see which Hebrew root words are used and in what order. Some readers will find beauty in this. Read [more about HIERO here](notes.md).

# Parameters
Two parameters guide the translation:

1. **The English word order always reflects the Hebrew word order.** Maintaining Hebrew word order lets the reader feel more of the poetic texture of the underlying Hebrew.

2. **Each Hebrew root and all of its derivatives are always represented by derivatives of a single English root. Unrelated Hebrew words are represented by unrelated English words.** This root-for-root translation parameter makes many word associations more apparent in English than is possible in a translation. Exception are made for some pronouns, simple prepositions, and other function words for which word choices are probably less significant. You can read more [about the root-for-root translation parameter here](lexicon.md).

Following these two parameters—the second one especially—makes it impossible to translate into normal English. Instead, the text is only partially translated—the morphology is mostly English, but the idiom is not. The vocabulary is based on English roots but extended in unfamiliar ways.
